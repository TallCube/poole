## Marketing Optimization Update:
## Retail Conversion and Transaction Data Analysis

### Testing Status
Your first marketing split (A/B) test launched last week. This experiment measures the impact of additional product copy and PYT page sequencing on your website’s sales performance.

Our goal is to dramatically increase the conversion rate (and revenue) among first-time buyers.  Early sales results through the weekend and Monday morning have been above expectation. That said, our sample size is too small and too little time has passed to make statistically significant claims. We hope to have an exciting follow-up in the coming days.

### Targeting “High Potential” Visitors
It's normal for any e-Commerce business to show repeat visitors out-performing new visitors. First-time visitors will always appear to be less valuable than repeat visitors.
However, the quality and clarity of the first-time visitor's experience is what determines the likelihood he or she chooses to return and/or order.

Our priority is improving first-time buyer conversion rates. Existing customers are unlikely to be influenced by marketing copy improvements to the same degree as a new visitor, as they have already bought and decided to buy again. There isn't anything they don't already understand insofar as it influences their buying behavior.

Focusing our attention on new visitors and first-time buyers will produce the highest impact in the short term.  Once that issue is addressed we will move on to other marketing objectives including cart abandonment and paid advertising.

## Retail Conversion Analysis

### Summary View
For clarity’s sake, we have only included data samples regarding the most critical insights and processes. This analysis involves large data sets collected with multiple tools over a several week period. Including every scrap of data would transform this report into a database.

As always, we're careful to highlight the difference between facts uncovered by data-driven analysis and “if-this-then-maybe-that” hypotheses.

### Updated Funnel Performance Rates
  
**Important:** Please refer to the attached PDF titled 'PYT Funnel Visualization'.

Inside is a breakdown of the current Plan Your Trip sales funnel’s performance across all website visitors.

To the left of each step is a table of incoming users and the pages they were on previously. Most users enter the PYT funnel via the previous step, and entries after the “Name / Email” step are mostly tech glitches, disconnections, and weird exceptions.

To the right are users leaving each step for another page on the website. Users that leave the website entirely (via tab/window close or navigating to a new domain) are lost in the “jump” between two steps.

Between each step are the percentage and number of users that continued to the next step of the PYT ordering process. The rate of visitor decay across each step is known as “falloff” or abandonment rates.

As we discussed in our last report, the the first three steps and final checkout carry the largest abandonment rates. Our first impressions remain valid after 1,400 unique visitors.

Large abandonment rates during the first few steps of the PYT process is the single largest obstacle to producing more retail sales. Your first marketing experiment was designed to improve funnel abandonment during these stages.

### Mobile and Desktop: Traffic Volume and Sales Performance

Milk Stork's audience divides into two sets of two variables of users. These classifications are based on their previous visits and the device through which they experience the Milk Stork website.

User Status:  **[New Visitor]**   -- OR --   **[Repeat Visitor]**
                                                      
Device Type:  **[Desktop]**    -- OR --   **[Mobile]**

Each of these either-or variables can be combined to form a total of four major audience subgroups.

For example, we can observe considerable differences in the behavior and purchasing patterns between [Repeat + Desktop] and [New + Mobile] users.

**IMPORTANT:** The term “repeat visitor” in this context does not mean “repeat customer”.  A repeat visitor is anyone who has previously visited Milk Stork and does so at any future date. All repeat customers are repeat visitors. Not all repeat visitors are repeat buyers.  A purchase from a new visitor in this context means someone has bought from your website having never visited your website on that device in the past.  We expect there to be a very small percentage of new visitors that are repeat buyers acting on a new computer or phone.

Differences among these groups are so pronounced that we believe this to be the single most efficient lens through which to look for performance gains.

The chart below examines the click-through rate per unique visitor across all four user segments.  The dropoff between blue and red bars is the loss in visitors between the homepage and the Plan Your Trip page.  These users never visit the Plan Your Trip page before leaving the website.

Milk Stork’s high rate of new user abandonment, especially on mobile devices, presents an enormous opportunity.   Improving mobile sales performance will significantly impact retail sales.  We consider mobile to be our second marketing priority next to increasing product clarity.

Our team is currently in the planning stage of a home page redesign intended to improve click-through-rates to the Plan Your Trip process.

Despite the fact that mobile users are the majority of your visitors, they are an extreme minority of customers. Mobile sales are a small fraction of desktop sales.

We are confident that near-term marketing efforts will dramatically improve the mobile experience and raise sales. Differences in new and returning mobile users give us reason to believe new mobile users are confused or unconvinced. We do not think an aversion to buying via mobile is the fundamental issue.

**Performance Table Takeaways:**
* New Mobile users are 41% of your website’s traffic, yet are only 2.4% of your sales.
* Improving mobile conversion rates is essential to boosting retail sales.  We are currently developing tests prioritizing the mobile visitor group with the help of the Angular2 build.
* First-impression buyers are 31% of retail sales. Improving product copy is highly likely to improve sales performance given the current rates of new user adoption. We expect this segment to continue improving in the near future.

**Miscellaneous Facts:**
* New Mobile checkout step conversion rates are roughly 8%. Approximately 50 of 1200 New Mobile visitors made it to the final checkout.  This is the single highest abandonment rate across the entire website.
* 20% of Desktop users are suspected to be male -- but there’s no good way to measure these matters in the case of shared computers at work or home.
* 100% of all customers are between the ages of 24 and 45. There are a notable number of visitors (male and female) from outside these age ranges, but they have never made a purchase.
* Zero iPhone buyers are under 34 years old. Women over 34 have been shown to complete orders on their phones.  All mobile buyers are tagged as female.

## Transaction Data Analysis
Milk Stork’s transaction data spans over 600,000 lines of nested XML metadata. The upside to this complexity is that there’s an enormous wealth of information hidden in this data.  The downside, unfortunately, is that sifting through it all is more difficult than anticipated.

In order to keep on schedule as best we can, we’ll use downtime between test development sprints to analyze this information. Rather than dedicating equal time and effort to transaction data analysis and marketing optimization, I’ve opted to highlight a few key insights each report.

As far as this information aids operations, I am unsure of which answers or ideas hold the highest potential impact.  Please let us know if there is a particular idea that interests you. I’d be happy to produce a more substantial data table for you.

This data contains thousands of retail sales between July 2016 to the end of January 2017. There are no enterprise sales or user accounts involved.

* **~90% accuracy tracking sales via conversion analytics:** We’re tracking a very high percentage of all sales and our conversion data will be extremely reliable. The item is arguably the most important factor of all, given that website optimization decisions rely on sound data. Google Analytics (or any similar package) will never be able to track users with Javascript disabled or adBlockers.

* **~15% of buyers place a second order:** The overwhelming majority of user accounts, emails, phone numbers, and home shipping addresses have only ever placed a single order.  We’ve checked and double-checked this figure. It seems that 85% of buyers never re-order through the retail channel.

*Note:* If a retail customer becomes an enterprise user after placing one order, we will not recognize their repeat order under this methodology. We will look at retail to enterprise user conversion rates next time.

* **Roughly 30 users have ordered between 6 and 21 times:** This group appear to order at least twice per month across the lifetime of their accounts. I suspect these high-frequency customers create the order density required to achieve the previously discussed overall reorder rate of 40%.

* **Over 33% of all sales include at least one Tote product:** Perhaps this was expected by your team, but the marketing team initially assumed that Totes were rarely bought before we looked into this.  Understanding how moms are buying Totes helped us craft the current marketing experiment.

*Question for next time:* Do new customers that order a single Tote product reorder at lower rates than other groups? If so, perhaps they had a confusing experience.

* **Cities Have Unique Rush Order Patterns:**  New York City receives the highest frequency of rush orders at 60% of all sales.  All other metropolitan areas receive similar levels of rush orders between 20% to 40%. Trips to Vegas are the exception: very few of those shipments are rushed.  Rural cities and towns rarely rush order.

* **Most shipments are both TO and FROM major cities:** The most popular shipping destinations are also the most popular receiving destinations. I expected middle-America to have a larger footprint on shipments -- but it appears that the bulk of orders are from Metro A to Metro B.  This is an area that may warrant more investigation if operations would find it useful.

## Remarketing

We have strong evidence that many buyers were previously viewed your website and left, having chosen not buy in the moment. Roughly 30% of your sales are from users that returned between 12 and 90 days later to make a purchase.

![Graph4](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bhYUNcUbTd45kLWchvrJpJo2IgmWI5p27HevaszrN6ScHnLV_tzDJlQ8FI_jy-hx13u6oLWlTXqFoo4nZFVyTAb4RRObW0X3mnQZ-EAWc3w_ywwUk90Hq_3sSakUx7SCUBGVPah_ "Graph4")

This data set is limited to a 12 week window. Extending beyond 90 days is not supported by  Google Analytics. It’s worth noting that these tracked sales only occurred in the last ~3 week period. It is entirely possible that the “tail end” of this graph -- returning users in the second and third months -- will grow with time as we refine our data.

This behavior gives us reason to believe two things:

1. Advertising may result in a large number of considerably delayed sales.  If a direct response advertising campaign was immediately profitable from day-one sales alone, then the delayed sales over a 3-month period would act to amplify the campaign’s returns.

2. Milk Stork is a perfect candidate for remarketing campaigns. Remarketing campaigns are designed to target only your previous visitors and prompt the audience to return to your website.

We suggest remarketing campaigns (via AdWords, Facebook, and Display) as a means of further encouraging previous visitors to return to Milk Stork during the one to three month delay period.

Remarketing campaigns are advertising campaigns that are only shown to people who have previously visited Milk Stork's website. You can choose to only show ads to previous visitors that have been away from your website for a certain number of days.

Remarketing campaigns are generally accepted as the form of paid advertising with highest ROI available to online businesses.

The only downside to remarketing campaigns is the setup time required. Prior to launch, each ad platform must have their own tracking code placed on your website.

These tracking codes must be installed weeks or months in advance of launching any long-term remarketing testing.

**We suggest installing the following remarketing cookies:**
* AdWords (Completed)
* Facebook (Action Required)
* Display Networks (Scheduled)

Remarketing on Facebook will be especially advantageous as it allows us to test Milk Stork creatives among a population already accepting of the brand.  These advertising tests will work as an optimization “incubator” for more general ad campaigns in the future.

We would like you to share your Facebook ad tracking codes with us so we can install it on the website. We’ll follow up shortly with simple instructions on the matter.

Talk soon,
Wes
