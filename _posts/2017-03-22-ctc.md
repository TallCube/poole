# Click-To-Call Projections

Kate and Mike,

Click-to-Call (CTC) mobile ordering has a high likelihood of increasing Milk Stork's monthly retail orders and profitability.

Roughly 4,000 mobile users visit Milk Stork's homepage each month. Of those, around 40% (or ~1,600) reach the PYT page.

**Hypothesis:** Adding a CTC option on the first page of the PYT process will increase mobile sales and gross margin by considerably more than the associated marginal costs.

Below are two tables. The first table examines the marginal costs, revenues, and margins of each new order placed via phone. The second table examines the end-of-month impact of the sum of all orders.

*Table: Unitary / Marginal Order Breakdown*

| Outcome | Call Cost | Conversion Rate | Acq. Cost | Margin |
| -----   | --------- | --------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Best    |  $5       |     50%         |   $10     |  $50   |
| Medium  |  $10      |     33%         |   $30     |  $30   |
| Worst   |  $15      |     25%         |   $60     |  $0    |

**Resulting Call Volume:** We assumed 25% of mobile PYT visitors begin the CTC process. This generates a monthly increase in call volume of 100 calls per week, or 400 calls per month.

*Table: Monthly Order Breakdown*

| Outcome | Sales | Revenue | Costs  | Post-CS Margin | ROI  |
| -----   | ----- | ------- | ------ | -------------- | ---- |
| Best    |  200  | $40,000 | $2,000 |     $10,000    | 500% |
| Medium  |  132  | $26,200 | $3,960 |      $3,960    | 100% |
| Worst   |  100  | $20,000 | $6,000 |          $0    |   0% |


## Deal-Breakers

Click-To-Call will struggle if either of the following conditions are true:

- Fewer than 1-in-10 calls results in a sale.
- Average call times (all calls) exceeds 15 minutes.

We do not and will never endorse an active CTC campaign if it proves itself unprofitable.

## CTC Does Not Replace Mobile Checkout

Offering customers multiple checkout options is the norm among high-value e-commerce businesses. CTC does not compete with our long-term goals optimizing Milk Stork's online / automated mobile checkout.

We expect a large number of customers will enjoy the ability to order while hands-free when driving. Some customers may find  comfort in ordering on the phone with a real person.

Increasing mobile orders is one of our highest priorities. We would keep CTC active even in a scenario where we had a perfectly optimized online checkout process.

## Request for Greenlight

The marketing team would like to launch a simple CTC test starting this Friday.

Only mobile users visiting the primary PYT page would be shown the CTC button.

We highly suggest and request a unique call-center phone number to use for this CTC campaign. We must isolate marginal costs and orders generated via this new process. It will be difficult to judge CTC profitability and ROI without a unique telephone number.

Thank you,
Wes @ Tall Cube
